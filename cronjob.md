Here's a `README.md` file template specifically for a **cron job** setup. This assumes you're setting up a cron job for tasks like backups, log rotation, or scheduled scripts.

# Cron Job Setup

This project includes a cron job that performs scheduled tasks such as automated backups, file cleanups, or log archiving.

## 🛠 Prerequisites

- Linux environment with `cron` service enabled.
- Necessary script(s) placed in the correct path with executable permissions.
- (Optional) AWS CLI configured, if uploading to S3 or cloud services.

## 📁 Script Location

Your cron job script should be stored in a suitable location, such as:

```bash
/usr/local/bin/backup_script.sh
````

Ensure the script is executable:

```bash
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/backup_script.sh
```

## ⏱️ Cron Job Schedule

To edit cron jobs:

```bash
crontab -e
```

Add the following line to schedule the job (example: run every hour):

```cron
0 * * * * /usr/local/bin/backup_script.sh >> /var/log/cronjob.log 2>&1
```

### Explanation of Schedule:

| Field   | Value | Meaning           |
| ------- | ----- | ----------------- |
| Minute  | `0`   | At 0 minutes      |
| Hour    | `*`   | Every hour        |
| Day     | `*`   | Every day         |
| Month   | `*`   | Every month       |
| Weekday | `*`   | Every day of week |

## 🔐 Permissions

Make sure your script has the correct file permissions and access rights for any files or services it interacts with.

If using cloud services like AWS:

* Ensure proper IAM role or AWS credentials are set via environment or `~/.aws/credentials`.

## 📦 Example: Backup Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash

TIMESTAMP=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M")
BACKUP_DIR="/var/log/postgresql"
ZIP_FILE="/tmp/pg_logs_$TIMESTAMP.zip"
S3_BUCKET="s3://your-s3-bucket-name"

echo "[INFO] Backup started at $(date)"

cd / || exit 1
zip -r "$ZIP_FILE" "$BACKUP_DIR"

aws s3 cp "$ZIP_FILE" "$S3_BUCKET"

echo "[INFO] Backup completed at $(date)"
```

## 📜 Logs

You can redirect cron job output to a log file:

```bash
>> /var/log/cronjob.log 2>&1
```

Monitor logs using:

```bash
tail -f /var/log/cronjob.log
```

## ✅ Validation

* Use `crontab -l` to view active cron jobs.
* Use `systemctl status cron` or `sudo service cron status` to ensure the service is running.
* Check logs for output and error handling.
